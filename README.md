# intermezzOS

This is a small hobby OS, written in Rust. It is not particularly serious. I’m
not yet at the point where I have to actually worry about design decisions, so
we’ll see what it ends up like.

Check the `original_backup` branch for now.

Also, feel free to join us at `#intermezzOS` on Freenode’s IRC network, if you
want to chat.
