# Nucleus

This is a small hobby OS, written in Rust. It is not particularly serious. I’m
not yet at the point where I have to actually worry about design decisions, so
we’ll see what it ends up like.

I’m going to be writing up my experiences as I go, as well as distilling the
finished bits into a tutorial. You can find all that stuff in [the documentation].

[the documentation]: http://steveklabnik.github.io/nucleus/

Right now, this repo will look a bit bare. Since I did not start by actually
writing up docs, I’ve re-set the code on this branch, and am doing it again
from scratch. The furthest I got is saved in the [`original_backup`
branch](https://github.com/steveklabnik/nucleus/tree/original_backup). So for
now, that will probably be more interesting than this will.
